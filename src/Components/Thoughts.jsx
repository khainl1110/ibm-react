            <h1>Thoughts</h1>
            <h6>These are my thoughts on things I learn about, they are not really organized <br />
                I'm always excited about new technologies and want to learn them

            <p>
               MaterialUI <br />
               It's a very good library and speed up my web development a lot <br />
               Before knowing about MaterialUI, I often write the CSS myself for my React App and that's very time consuming <br />
               Now I can focus on writing my app, state management, fetch API, etc and MaterialUI takes care of the rest <br />
               In addition, what I like about MaterialUI is that it follow Material Design by Google and the result is very consistent
            </p>
            <p>
                React <br />
                After using React for many schools/clubs projects, I have to admit it's one of the best thing for web developer <br />
                Instead of having 3 separate files for html, css and javascript, now you only need one javascript file for one page <br />
                React ecosystem is so vast and help you with various things, like MaterialUI, so that you can spend more time for worrying about state management and overall user experiences of the app <br />

                AWS <br />
                AWS is a service that has a really big impact on cloud computing and being used by many big companies <br />
                I want to learn more about cloud computing in general, especially AWS and what it is capable of <br />
                I also want to learn other things as well such as Security, AI, ML, etc <br />
                The cost of using AWS services are very cheap and I'm surprised how cheap it actually is <br />
                EC2 instance are very famous and I want to learn how to use it <br />
                The experience working with Serverless Suite was really good, I like how it can host backend on the cloud natively with Lambda function <br />
            </p>

                DynamoDB <br />
                DynamoDB is very interesting, instead of having unique key, it allows 2 value to be part of unique key <br />
                This eliminate one column of data and can be very useful, however, there are some benefit of using relational database that this doesn't offer <br />
                Therefore, this is suited more for storing data that can be stored in one single row and not composed of complex parts <br />
                I can see how this is suited for mobile application where each row is a complete user's data
