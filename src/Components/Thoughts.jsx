               MaterialUI <br />
               It's a very good library and speed up my web development a lot <br />
               Before knowing about MaterialUI, I often write the CSS myself for my React App and that's very time consuming <br />
               Now I can focus on writing my app, state management, fetch API, etc and MaterialUI takes care of the rest <br />
               In addition, what I like about MaterialUI is that it follow Material Design by Google and the result is very consistent

                AWS <br />
                AWS is a service that has a really big impact on cloud computing <br />
                I want to learn more about cloud computing in general, especially AWS and what it is capable of <br />
                I also want to learn other things as well such as Security, AI, ML, etc <br />
                The cost of using AWS services are very cheap and I'm surprised how cheap it actually is <br />
                EC2 instance are very famous and I want to learn how to use it <br />
                The experience working with Serverless Suite was really good, I like how it can host backend on the cloud natively with Lambda function <br />

                DynamoDB <br />
                DynamoDB is very interesting, instead of having unique key, it allows 2 value to be part of unique key <br />
                This eliminate one column of data and can be very useful, however, there are some benefit of using relational database that this doesn't offer <br />
